# Real time CMR Reconstruction

Uses the BART toolbox (https://github.com/mrirecon/bart) to do parallel imaging - compressed sensing reconstruction of real-time cardiac MRI data. Requires the PC VIPR wrapper (https://github.com/uwmri/pcvipr_wrapper) to read the data and export it in BART (.cfl) format.
